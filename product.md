### **Product strategy**

 - Product strategy answers the question:
“How will our product delight customers, in hard to copy, margin-enhancing ways?” 
If you’re not in that position periodically, you’re not leaning far enough forward.
Because you want to sometimes lean far enough forward that you land on your face. 
That’s how we innovate!

 - Product thinking is that it is the skill of knowing what makes a product useful — and loved — by people.
Product thinking is the skill of understanding and being good at predicting what people want.

These types of questions get at the product thinking mindset: 
 - Critique Product X — which decisions seem the most responsible for its success? Why? 
 - How would you help Product X win over Audience Y if you were its leader?
 - Take Problem Z … What would you design to solve it?

### **Product thinking**

 How do you develop your product thinking skills? The two most important habits are observation and inquiry.

Observation is about paying attention to people’s reactions when they encounter products or services in their day-to-day lives.

It’s easiest to start by observing yourself. When do you feel delighted by a product? When do you feel annoyed?

Once you’re in the habit of continually observing your own reactions, observe also the reactions of those around you. When do your friends gush about a new discovery? When do they complain? What’s their feedback about the products you recommend? Finally, observe the world’s reactions. What are the reviews saying? What are the opinions on the Internet that people are picking up and repeating? What differentiates this product from those of its competitors? Most importantly, why are people saying the things they’re saying? As you develop the habit of observing your own relationship with products and then generalizing this to your friends and the broader world, it will lead to more questions that will help you gain an even deeper understanding.

Inquiry comes from genuine curiosity about people and their behaviors, and can take different forms depending on how you learn best. The key is understanding the “why” behind the reactions. Some ways of doing this includes:
 - Reading books about human thinking/behavior;
 - Dissecting cultural phenomena through articles, discussions, blogs;
 - Soliciting customer feedback in the process of building products;
 - Asking others why they have the reactions they do;

Of course, to arrive at a true understanding, you’ll need to dig deeper than simply taking people at their word when they tell you what they like and what they want. This is where data (from user research and customer discovery to market data, clicks, views, etc.) becomes valuable.

If you’re looking for a quick rule of thumb to proactively develop your product thinking, try the below:
 - Every week, try at least one new product, feature, or service.
 - Every week, have at least one conversation or reflection about how a specific product decision impacts its intended audience.

The best we can do is hypothesize. But with a mindset of observation and inquiry, builders do not have to rely purely on guesses. They can gather feedback — both qualitative and quantitative — to help them understand how customers feel. It’s the repeated process of learning, feedback, and iteration that both improves the product and the builder’s sense of what makes for an improved product. If you build or work with builders, it pays to develop your product thinking.
