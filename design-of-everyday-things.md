# Design of everyday things

Two most important characteristics of good design are:    
**Discoverability**: is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?  
**Understanding**: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?

## **Engineering + Psychology + Cognitive Science**  

We were designing things for people, so we needed to understand both technology and people.  
Why are people having problems? You are being too logical. You are designing for people the way you would like them to be, not for the way they really are.

**Human-centered design**, an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving. 
Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible, what is happening, and what is about to happen. 
Communication is especially important when things go wrong. It is relativitely easy to design things that work smoothly and harmoniously as long as things go right. But as soon as there is a problem or a misunderstanding, the problems arise. This is where good design is essential. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned. Actually, this is where the most satisfaction can arise: when something goes wrong but the machine highlights the problems, then the person understands the issue, takes the proper actions, and the problem is solved. When this happens smoothly, the collaboration of person and device feels wonderful. HCD is a design philosophy. it means starting with a good understanding of people and the need that the design is intended to meet. Understanding comes from observing people, avoid specifying the problem and instead iterate upon repeated approximations - done through rapid tests of ideas, and after each test modifying the approach and problem definition.

Discoverability  
Five fundamental psychological concepts - affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, feedback.  
There is a sixth, most important of all: the conceptual model (provides true understanding);
